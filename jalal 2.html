                Online shops give us the opportunity to shop 24/7 and also reward us with a 'no pollution' shopping experience. There is no better place to buy informational products like e-books, which are available to you instantly as soon as the payment goes through. Downloadable items purchased online eliminate the need for any kind of physical material at all, as well, which helps the environment!

            <h1 align="center">Better Prices</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Cheap deals and better prices are available online, because products come to you direct from the manufacturer or seller without involving middlemen. Plus, it's easier to compare prices and find a better deal. Many online sites offer discount coupons and rebates, as well.

            <h1 align="center">More Variety</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                The choices online are amazing. You can find almost any brand or item you're looking for. You can get in on the latest international trends without spending money on airfare. You can shop from retailers in other parts of the state, country, or even the world instead of being limited to your own geography. A far greater selection of colors and sizes than you will find locally are at your disposal.

            <h1 align="center">You Can Send Gifts More Easily</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Sending gifts to relatives and friends is easy, no matter where they are. All the packaging and shipping are done for you. Oftentimes, they'll even gift wrap it for you! Now, there is no need to make distance an excuse for not sending a gift on occasions like birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and so forth.

            <h1 align="center">More Control</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Many times, when we opt for conventional shopping, we tend to spend a lot more than planned and end up buying items that aren't exactly what we wanted (but we can't find anything better in the store). Online, you don't have to let the store's inventory dictate what you buy, and you can get exactly what you want and need.
                </font>
            </p>
            <h1 align="center">Easy Price Comparisons</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Comparing and researching products and their prices is so much easier online. If you're shopping for appliances, for example, you can find consumer reviews and product comparisons for all the options on the market, with links to the best prices. We can research firsthand experience, ratings, and reviews for most products and retailers.

            <h1 align="center">No Crowds</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                If you are like me, you hate crowds when you're shopping. Especially during holidays, festivals, or on weekends, they can be such a huge headache. Also, being crushed in the crowds of shoppers sometimes makes us feel rushed or hurried. You don't have to battle for a parking place. All of these problems can be avoided when you shop online.
                </font>

            <h1 align="center">No Pressure</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Oftentimes when we're out shopping, we end up buying things that we don't really need, all because shopkeepers pressure us or use their selling skills to compel us to make these purchases.
                </font>

            <h1 align="center">You Can Buy Used or Damaged Items at Lower Prices</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                The marketplace on the internet gives us access to listings of old or damaged items at rock-bottom prices. Also, if we want to buy antiques, there's no better place to find great ones.
                </font>

            <h1 align="center">Discreet Purchases Are Easier</h1>
            <p align="center">
                <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Some things are better done in the privacy of your home. Online shops are best for discreet purchases of things like adult toys, sexy lingerie, and so on. This enables me to purchase undergarments and lingerie without embarrassment or any paranoia that there are people watching or judging me.

        <h1 align="center">10 Disadvantages of Shopping Online</h1>
        <h1>1. Negative Environmental Impact of Packaging and Gas</h1>
        <h1>2. Shipping Problems and Delays</h1>

        <h1>4. Spending Too Much Time Online</h1>

        <h1 align="center"> Negative Environmental Impact of Packaging and Gas</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Having your purchase packed in several layers of plastic and cardboard packaging and delivered right to your front door is good for you but not so great for the environment. Even if you try to recycle the cardboard, you're creating unnecessary waste by shopping online.

        <h1 align="center"> Shipping Problems and Delays</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Even the biggest and best shipping companies and online retailers have their bad days, so there's no way to ensure that you'll get your hands on your purchase in time unless you pick it up from a store. Items get lost, detoured, damaged, or delivered to the wrong address more often than you can imagine.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h1 align="center">Risk of Fraud</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                If you're shopping online, there's a larger risk of fraud: credit card scams, phishing, hacking, identity theft, counterfeit products, bogus websites, and other scams are common

        <h1 align="center"> Spending Too Much Time Online</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Especially if your job requires that you look at a computer all day, you might get burnt out on all that screen time. Shopping online can turn into a marathon of scrolling and clicking down rabbit holes, and before you know it, you've been online for most of the day. The internet is a nice place to visit, but you probably don't want to live there.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h1 align="center"> Less Contact With the Community</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                If you do all your business online, you'll never have to leave your home. This might be great for a while, but sometimes, you might want to go outside, breathe some fresh air, get a change of scenery, talk to real people, participate in your community, and just be a part of the crowd. Sometimes, a computer monitor can't compete with a real human connection.

        <h1 align="center"> You Don't Know Exactly What You're Getting</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Unless you are intimately familiar with a brand or product, buying online requires a leap of faith . . . one that doesn't always end in your favor. Sizes are often imprecise. You can't determine texture, fabric, fit, cut, quality, heft, or durability just by looking at a photo. Products that looked great might feel chintzy, awkward, or cheap when you hold them in your hands.
            </font>
        </p> 
        <h1 align="center">Returns Can Be Complicated</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Some sellers make the process breezy, but many make it extra hard for you to return their merchandise or get a refund. Many times, you can't get reimbursed for any shipping costs.Labeling, packaging, shipping, tracking, and filling out all the proper forms are a hassle you can avoid if you buy in person (and if you hand-select your merchandise, you won't need to return things so often).

        </p>
        <h1 align="center" Unfriendly, Scammy, or Complicated Websites></h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                Some sites require that you join their mailing list and make it impossible to unsubscribe. Some sell your email address to others, so your email is full of ads. Sometimes, sites don't offer good or accurate descriptions of the goods, or you just can't figure out how to purchase or return an item or speak to customer service.
            </font>
        </p>
    
        <h1 align="center"> No Sales Assistance</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                In a store, there's usually someone to help you but online, you're on your own. If you're confused or have questions, it's just too bad for you. You might have to make blind purchases and mistakes you'll regret later because there was no one to talk to.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h1 align="center">No Support for Local Retailers</h1>
        <p align="center">
            <font face="Calibri" size='5'>
                If everyone started doing all their shopping online, all the local stores would go out of business. When all the stores in town are gone, we'll have to drive further and further away to shop at a real store.
